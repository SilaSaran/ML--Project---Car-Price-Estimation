# ML--Project---Car-Price-Estimation

Car Price Prediction Using Regression Models:

This project explores predicting car prices based on multiple technical and categorical features using a range of regression models. 
The dataset, CarPrice_Assignment.csv, includes specifications such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, and brand, making it suitable for regression analysis and model comparison.


Key Components:

•	Data Preprocessing: Cleaned missing values, standardized brand names, encoded categorical features, and scaled inputs.
•	Model Implementation: Trained five models — Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVR — for comparative analysis.
•	Model Evaluation: Assessed performance using R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Random Forest delivered the best results.
•	Feature Importance: Identified key drivers of car prices using feature importances and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
•	Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimized Random Forest parameters via GridSearchCV, leading to noticeable performance improvements.


Outcome:

This analysis highlights how different machine learning models perform on regression tasks and demonstrates the impact of feature selection and tuning on predictive performance.


Translating  Results into Business Insights & Showing how the findings will support decision-making:

•	If the manufacturer wants to offer lower-priced models, focusing on features like engine downsizing or targeting budget-friendly brands could help.
•	Brand perception has a measurable impact on price — marketing strategy will play a key role.

Takeaway:

End with a summary:

•	This analysis provides a powerful predictive model and clear insights into what drives car pricing in the U.S. market. It arms the company with the knowledge to design competitive products and pricing strategies.


Final Verdict:

•	The business goal of understanding car price dynamics was successfully achieved.
•	The project uncovered how key features such as engine size, horsepower, and brand influence pricing.
•	Ensemble models—especially Random Forest—demonstrated strong predictive power with high R² scores.
•	Model performance was further enhanced using hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV), validating the reliability of predictions.
•	Feature importance and RFE provided actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.
•	The results empower management to align product design and marketing strategies with target price points across different markets.
